CS1430 Final Project: Image Relighting

# Team

# Project

We are interested in image relighting techniques using neural networks. Specifically, we have found two papers, [Deep Single Image Portrait Relighting](https://zhhoper.github.io/dpr.html) and [Single Image Portrait Relighting](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ravir/portrait_relighting.pdf) that interest us. Our project would be to first implement the process laid out in one of the two papers (we are leaning towards the first one as it has the most data and documentation) and then if we can get that working we would want to expand our project into a somewhat usable application or Python script for better usability or perhaps creative uses in editing software.
